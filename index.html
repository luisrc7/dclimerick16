                        Drupal 7 Slide 1
                        Intro

                    <section>
                        Drupal 7 Slide 1
                        What is content and what is configuration (General)
                        1 is the Drupal Core
                        2 we have our custom modules we installed or we created, so basically anything inside sites
                        folder and profiles folder if using a profile.
                        3 then we have the files, some managed hosting companies keep the filesystem out of the web
                        server or even in a CDN.
                        4 is the database.

                    <section>
                        Drupal 7 Slide 2
                        Any config change won't be saved in files, so won't be saved in version control.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Drupal 7 Slide 3
                        personal experiences (bads). Personal fails.
                        Lots of problems with configuration, ending doing it on live, or not downloading the latest
                        version of the live site before doing the development, or some changed between your development
                        and the deployment, etc…. All this could cause to lose work or even make things not working on
                        the live site.
                    </section>

                        Drupal 7 Slide 4
                        How D7 manage configuration changes. (blocks, CT definitions, View updates, context rules)
                        Any of these changes are managed directly in the database.

                        Some workarounds like Features module or hook_update for modules and profiles.

                        How it works. (what you can and you can’t do)
                        Yaml files.

                        Maybe some history about CM in D8.
                        Export / import
                        Single or full
                        Through the UI as well
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Drupal 8 Slide 4
                        The new features in CM for D8. Is sitting in config manager menu.
                        Features still exist as per it's original purpose, package different elements that creates a
                        feature together.

                        Drupal 8 Slide 6
                        3 ways of preventing:
                        1) not allow config in UI: module config_readonly
                        2) old fashion sync database into DEV and config export.
                        3) Drush command: "drush config-merge @live-site --git"

                    <section>
                        Drupal 8 Slide 7
                        Benefits.
                        1 - You can rollback configuration because is in git.
                        2 - automatation workflow as well.

                    <section>
                        Drupal 8 Slide 5
                        CM is not magic, config is in code, but has to be "imported" to the DB for the run time.
                        Also it won't solve problems like 2 people changing config at the same time.
                        Drush option --partial

                        Drupal 8 Slide 5
                        If custom module you can provide configuration file, but it will only be read once.
                        There is a project for that: config_update

                        Drupal 8 Slide 5
                        Be careful as when you delete a configuration you might delete dependencies.
                        Also dealing with change field names e.g. is not possible through the CM, maybe use a update_n function.
